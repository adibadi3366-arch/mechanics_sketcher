Then middle-click, or click empty space, where the dimension should go and type its value. The first length dimension only sets the scale: the line keeps its size and is worth what you typed. Every later one is measured against it, and the drawing follows the number. Type text such as 2a to show a label in its place." },

  lineload: { title: "Distributed load", body: "Click a line, on the side the load should be drawn. The side panel sets the magnitude at each end (different ones give a triangle or a trapezium), the number of arrows, the colour and whether the area under the arrows is shaded. Drag an end of the load along the line to make it cover only part of it." },
  moment: { title: "Moment", body: "Click a joint, or a spot on a line, to put a moment about it. Its magnitude sets the radius of the arc, at a scale all moments share. Drag it round, or press R, to turn it; the side panel switches between clockwise and anticlockwise." },
  diagram: { title: "Diagram", body: "Lays a plot along a member, the way an internal force diagram is drawn. Make the plot on the Plot tab first. Then click a line, an arc or a side of a beam, on the side positive values should go: the plot's range is stretched over the member. Drag the handle at the peak for the height, and the handles at the ends to cover only part of the member. Change a function on the Plot tab and the diagram follows." },
  frame: { title: "Axes", body: "Click where the coordinate axes should go; on a joint they stay pinned to it. Drag an arrow tip to change its length, and click a label to rename it." },
  arrow: { title: "Arrow", body: "Two clicks, like a line: where it starts and where it points. Then type its name, written as TeX math such as F_1, or just carry on. It is constrained and dimensioned like a line." },
  arcarrow: { title: "Curved arrow", body: "For moments and rotations. Click the centre, then where the arrow starts, sweep round and click where it ends." },

  centermark: { title: "Centre mark", body: "Click a circle or arc to give it centre lines. Drag an end of the mark to make it larger or smaller; the side panel sets how it is dashed." },
  balloon: { title: "Balloon", body: "Click what the balloon points at, then where it should sit. The numbers count up by themselves; click the text to change it. The side panel puts it in a circle or a box, underlines it, or leaves it bare." },
  fill: { title: "Fill", body: "Click inside a closed shape to fill it. The lines around it have to meet at shared points. The colour is picked in the side panel." },
  hatch: { title: "Hatching", body: "Click a line, arc or circle on the side the strokes should go, as for the ground under a support. Their size and number are set in the side panel." },

  spring: { title: "Spring", body: "Two clicks, like a line: where it starts and where it ends. It stretches and turns with its two ends, and a spring pulled longer gets more turns. Then type its name, such as k, or just carry on. The side panel draws it as a zigzag or as a coil and sets its width and how far apart its turns are." },
  damper: { title: "Damper", body: "Two clicks, like a line: the rod with the piston starts at the first, the cylinder is towards the second. Then type its name, such as c, or just carry on. The side panel sets its size and turns it round." },
  spiral: { title: "Torsion spring", body: "A spiral spring. Click the joint it is wound about, then where its outer end goes: on the part it holds, or anywhere. Drag that end to make the spiral larger; the side panel sets how far apart its windings are and which way it winds." },
  arcdamper: { title: "Torsion damper", body: "A damper bent round a joint. Click the joint, then where the rod starts, sweep round and click where the cylinder ends. The side panel sets its size and turns it round." },
  mass: { title: "Centre of mass", body: "Click a joint, a spot on a curve or anywhere to mark it as a centre of mass. Click its name to change it, and drag the name to move it. The point under the mark is constrained and dimensioned like any other." },
  measure: { title: "Measure", body: "Works like Dimension, but drives nothing: click a line, two points, two lines, a point and a line, or a circle, then click where it goes. It shows what the geometry measures, in brackets, and follows it as it changes. Only you see it: it is left out of the print and the exported figure. Drag it like a dimension; the side panel can turn it into a dimension." },
  etalon: { title: "Etalon", body: "A scale bar: click where it starts. Drag the handle at its far end to set its length and direction, and the bar to move it. Its name says what it is worth, such as 1\\,\\mathrm{m}, or 10\\,\\mathrm{kN} for forces drawn at a scale; click the name to type it. The side panel can mark it off into parts." },
  rightangle: { title: "Right angle", body: "Marks a right angle with a small square. Click two lines that meet, each on the side of the corner the mark goes in. The side panel adds a dot, moves the mark to another corner, and can hold the lines at a right angle if nothing does yet." },
  construction: { title: "Construction", body: "While this is on, the lines, circles and arcs you draw are construction lines: dashed here, and left out of the print and the exported figure. They take constraints and dimensions like anything else. Press it again to draw the figure itself." },

  plot: { title: "Plot", body: "A workspace of its own, for plotting functions. Type a formula of x in the side panel, such as 2x + 1 or sin(x); a function can have several pieces, each over its own stretch of the axis. Parametric adds a curve given by x(t) and y(t), such as a circle. Note and Balloon put text on the plot. On the left, the graph: drag and the wheel move around and zoom, and the dashed frame is the range that is exported; drag its handles or its edge to change it. On the right, the print: the plot as it is exported, where its handles set its size on paper. Flip axes turns it so the variable runs up and the values across. The ends of the axes take LaTeX, such as 2\\pi or \\frac{\\pi}{2}. Export saves the plot on show, as SVG or for pgfplots." },
  preview: { title: "Print preview", body: "This is the figure as it is exported, on its page: no helper lines, markers or grid, and text at its size in print. Everything in it is fitted to the figure width, with 5 % of it as a margin on every side; the dashed line marks the margin. Press Q again to go back to editing." },
  export: { title: "Export", body: "SVG saves a picture file. TikZ saves a .tex file to \\input in LaTeX, and Copy TikZ puts the same text on the clipboard. How wide the figure is, everything in it with a margin round it, and how large its text, is set in the box in the corner." },
